# GB-Compo-2023
Repository for our GB Compo 2023 entry

So far, this is the rough story and mechanic synopsis:

>Gameplay-wise, we’ve been talking about side-scrolling gameplay in chat, so we want to run with that for our main “level/boss” portions (more on that in a bit). GBStudio seems to handle sidescrolling pretty well so hopefully that will allow us to focus on cool mechanics and combat, etc. We’ve also discussed the ability to gain power/abilities via body-parts (or the like) from defeated monsters. This will be a core mechanic, and hopefully we can build some fun gameplay around it.  In between levels, the player will visit a city with NPCs which will be done top-down (Pokemon) style. Here is where the player will get most of their story and characterization via dialogue with NPCs. All of this will be punctuated with cutscenes and other forms of exposition (maybe journal entry-type blurbs?). This will serve to tell the following story:

>Story Synopsis (names are placeholders): Years ago, the ancient city of Tura was besieged by a powerful warlord named Raida. Armed with a relic that granted them monstrous power, Raida was able to assemble a massive army of mercenaries. The city was doomed from the start, but its people defended its walls to the end. During the siege, one of Raida’s lieutenants (we’ll call them the Traitor for now), horrified at the destruction wrought on the city, turned on their commander. The Traitor stole the relic and used it to defeat Raida, shattering the source of the warlord’s power. Before their demise, Raida curses the Traitor and the city, dooming them to isolation and warning that if Tura is rebuilt, it will only be destroyed again. The cost of the Traitor’s “victory” was immense, for not only was Raida and the relic destroyed, but most of the city of Tura with it. The Traitor barely survived, losing one of their arms and having a large piece of the relic embedded in their chest. 
>Despite saving many of the citizens of Tura, the Traitor was looked upon with hatred and disdain. The people could not forget the Traitor’s part in the destruction of Tura, and would not forgive them. And yet they owed the Traitor a great debt for saving them. As the people set about rebuilding their city, it was decided that the Traitor would be exiled, only allowed to return to the city once a year to collect the debt owed to them (food and supplies) before returning to their home in the outskirts of Tura.
>Years pass, and Tura is rebuilt, its high walls raised once more. A new generation of people have been brought into the world, and though they hear the legends of Raida and the Traitor, they have not known war and destruction first-hand. Our game starts with the Traitor returning to Tura for their yearly supply run. While there, the city is attacked once more by a large monster, an omen which appears to be Raida’s curse coming to fruition. The Traitor defends the city, and with the help of the embedded relic shard, they defeat the monster, discovering a similar relic shard embedded within the monster’s severed arm. The Traitor is able to attach the severed arm in place of their own missing arm, and thus their power (and the relic’s power) grows.  Armed with this new power and once again feeling an obligation to protect the city, the Traitor battles other monsters, taking their abilities and shards in order to gain power so they might defeat Raida once more. But all power comes at a cost. The Traitor must sacrifice some of their own humanity, thus becoming the monster the people of Tura have always claimed they have been.
